'''
write a program to determine whether a triangle is equilateral,
isoceles, or scalene

for any shape to be a triangle, all sides must be of length > 0,
and the sum of the lengs of any two sides must be greater than
the length of the third side

PEDAC - problem, examples, data structures, algorithm, code

inputs: lengths of 3 sides as 3 separate arguments in the Triangle constructor
outputs: error if triangle is invalid, triangle type in the .kind attribute
    if the triangle sides are valid
